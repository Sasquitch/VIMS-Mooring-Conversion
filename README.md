# VIMS-Mooring-Conversion
Data provided by Walker Smith. 

To run the code, place the VIMS.py file in the folder containing the data and run the file. It will generate NetCDF files for any .xls files in the folder.

If the computer does not have python, install the newest version of Python, and Anaconda. https://www.python.org/ https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Install or update any required packages in the Anaconda terminal. The numpy package and netCDF4 package can be installed by the commands: pip install numpy pip install netcdf4

If any additional metadata needs to be added to the netCDF file, it can be added in the #global attributes section located at the end of the python file. Open the file in a text editor and add the new information using the syntax nc.name = 'information' nc should not be changed, it is the identity of the netCDF file, name is the name of the variable, and information is the desired text.

Errors:

If there is an error with any packages, they must be installed or updated in Anaconda. All the installed packages can be updated with the command: conda update --all Otherwise the package must be installed.

If any errors occur stating the presence of an unknown abbreviation, open the python file in a text editor, such as sublime, and add the abbreviation to the abbvdict, stdNameDict, or unitsDict dictionaries on line 24-32 of the file using the syntax 'abbreviation': 'correct name'. The 'correct name' can be located in the most recent netCDF standard name table. http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html
